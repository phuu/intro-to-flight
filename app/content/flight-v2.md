# Flight v2

- **Pull features out of core**
    - Event proxying (replaced by withEventProxy)
    - jQuery (replaced by withJQuery)
    - Maybe event delegation (new event API, automatic delegation)


- **Build a component/mixin ecosystem**
    - Small core; big userland
    - Provide base components with default setup


- **Simplify component definition**
    - The API right now looks simple; is complex


- **Tooling**
    - Linter (already built)
    - Chrome Extensions Inspector (already built)
    - Better developer UX (debug mode, error messaging, static typing)


- Get involved on GitHub
